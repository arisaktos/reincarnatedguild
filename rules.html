                    <h2>Guild rules</h2>
                    
                    
                   
                    <p>It's important for us that guild rules are followed by all its members. Breaking our rules will result in getting warning from the officers, and in case a member breaks rules even after the warning - he/she will be removed from the guild (including all his/her alts).</p>
                    
                    <h4>Raiding rules</h4>
                    <ol>
                        
                        <li>Our raid times/dates are Wednesday and Thursday 8:30-11:30 ST.</li>
                        <li>Signing up for raids is possible via in-game calendar. If you don't have invitation, notify the officers team.</li>
                        <li>You are required to be online and ready to raid 10 minutes prior to raid time.</li>
                        <li>Always be prepared. Bring flasks, food and make sure your gear is gemmed/enchanted. Make sure your gear is repaired.</li>
                        <li>Make sure you get your bonus loot coins before raid starts. Going back to 'pick up coins' is unacceptable.</li>
                        <li>Raid leader will explain tactics before each pull but you are still required to read or watch tactics before raid. If you have any questions or suggestions for boss kill, whisper raid leader directly or ask about them on discord. Do it between pulls, not during.</li>
                        <li>It is required to stay quiet during pulls. Only members who are calling out mechanics are allowed to talk.</li>
                        <li>If you're not able to attend a raid, you should notify one of the officers via in game whisper or put it in discord (there is a channel dedicated to absences).</li>
                        <li>If you're not able to attend a raid due to last minute emergency, notify officers as soon as you're able to log online. We understand those situations can happen.</li>
                        <li>Constantly missing a raid will result in changing your rank down to social.</li>
                        <li>We cannot guarantee a pernament raiding spot to anyone. There might be times you will be asked to sit out. Saying that, we try to be fair and allow for everyone to have chance for each boss kill.</li>
                        <li>Rerolling is permitted as long as your new main is geared enough for the content. Rerolling will start your trial again.</li>
                        <li>Trial usually lasts 4 raid nights. After that time you will receive officer feedback and will either be bumped to raider, or you will receive extra 2 raiding nights of trial.</li>
                        <li>Failing trial will result in receiving social rank.</li>
                        <li>Trial can be failed by either seriously underperforming, not being able to follow tactics or not showing up. Saying that, everyone will receive multiple occasions to prove improvement.</li>
                        
                    </ol>
                    
                    
                    <h4>Other activities</h4>
                    
                    <ol>
                    
                    <li>Any activities outside of raiding days are optional and will not affect your raiding attendance.</li>
                    <li>Guild members are encouraged to create guild events (outside of raiding). There is no need for officers approval. Create groups and events and have fun!</li>
                    </ol>
                    
       
                  <h4>Recruitment</h4>
                  <oL>
                     <li>If you're already a member, all your alts are welcome. Just whisper any officer for an invite.</li>
                      <li>If you want your friend to join our guild as a social, whisper any officer for guild invite.</li>
                      <li>If you want your friend to join our guild as a raider he/she has to apply via this link. <a href="https://bit.ly/2Wvqkoa" target="_blank" class="red-highlight">CLICK HERE</a></li>

                               <h4>Issues</h4>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Members who disrupt the overall harmony, flow and enjoyment of the Guild for others will receive a warning from the officers team.  If the disruption cannot be resolved, member will be removed from the guild.</li>
                        
                       <li> The following actions will resolve in being removed from the guild:
<ul>
                            <li>Harassment: aggressive pressure or intimidation towards fellow players. </li>
                        <li>Scamming & Phishing: defrauding fellow players.</li>
                      </ul>
                        </li>
                         <li>Any issues with guild members should be raised directly with an officer in whispers, message or a private party/discord conversation.</li>
                    </ol>
